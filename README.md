# FDS-FX | JavaFX Fluid Dynamic Simulator
JavaFX Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulator is a simple 2D and 3D fluid dynamics simulator.

## Description
This project has been inspired by [***Ten Minute Physics***](https://github.com/matthias-research/pages/blob/master/tenMinutePhysics/17-fluidSim.html) and is a tweaked version of the fluidSim project with added features. FDS-FX is capable of importing 3D objects and looking at fluid behaviour in 2D and 3D.

## Installation
**To be added in the near future**

## To Do
Many, many things. Add:
* SVG importation to simulation
* Main menu and simulation menu for better user experience
* 3D rendering with 3D object simulation (biggest side project)
* Heat transfer (for electronics, vehicles, etc)
* Higher Resolution Simulation (won't be real time, will be heavily GPU entensive)
* Suggestions:
  * ------

## Version Control
|Version|Date|Decription|Features|Bugs|
|-------|----|----------|--------|----|
|V0.1|11/11/2024|Basic Simulation with Circle|Simulation with circle. Able to view: pressure, streamlines, smoke, fps and vectores.|- Simulation doesn't work properly outside or near the perimeter of canvas.<br>- Circle reinitialisation doesn't change fluid sim until dragged.|
