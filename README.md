# FDS-FX | JavaFX Fluid Dynamic Simulator
### JavaFX Fluid Dynamics Simulator is a simple computational fluid dynamics simulator inspired by [***Ten Minute Physics***](https://github.com/matthias-research/pages/blob/master/tenMinutePhysics/17-fluidSim.html) and is a tweaked version of the fluidSim project with added features.

## JDK Installation
(**Pictures will be added to make installation easier**)
1. Go to *https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/* and choose JavaFX SDK version 17 or 21 for your machine (V21 is backwards compatible with V17, so choice is yours)
2. Download the SDK, unzip from Downloads folder and move into user jdk folder (`C:\Users\user\.jdks` on Windows or `/home/user/.jdks` on Linux)
3. Open Intellij (more IDE to be added to the installation guide), click on `â‹®` and then open 'edit' under configuration
4. In the newly opened tab, click on modify options and select 'Add VM Option'
5. In the VM textfield, add the following: `--module-path "C:\Users\The Workstation\.jdks\javafx-sdk-17.0.13\lib" --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.graphics`
6. Click 'Apply', close the tab and then open project structure under the fild dropdown menu
7. Navigate to libraries and press the `+`, select java and navigate to your .jdks folder
8. Open the downloaded jdk to the lib folder and then select said folder, finish off by appling and closing the tab
9. Make sure no errors appear in the main class. If errors do appear, try removing the lib folder from the libraries sub-tab and trying steps 7 and 8 again.

## To Do
Many, many things. Add:
* SVG/PNG importation to simulation ![25%](https://progress-bar.xyz/25)
* More fluids, mainly compressible fluids
* Seperate simulation time from drawing time (HOW????)
* Main menu and simulation menu for better user experience
* 3D rendering with 3D object simulation (biggest side project) ![25%](https://progress-bar.xyz/25)
* Heat transfer (for electronics, vehicles, etc), ambient temperature modifier, etc
* Higher Resolution Simulation (won't be real time, will be heavily GPU entensive, should be playback possible) ![75%](https://progress-bar.xyz/75)
* Save replay data (JSON, TXT, Custom File Format?)
* Multithreading 
* Suggestions:

## Version Control
|Version|Date|Decription|Features|Bugs|
|-------|----|----------|--------|----|
|V0.25|23/11/24|Frame by frame replays|-Switched recordings from time based to frame based.<br>-Added max recording duration based on available ram size|-Recordings can be bigger than expected leading JVM memory allocator to crash.<br>-All the same issues from the last version.|
|V0.2|19/11/24|Replays and Advanced 3D|-Added replays, recording higher resolution on playing back the recording in real time.<br>-Added more advanced camera operation for 3D simulation<br>-Partial implementation of image simulation|-Recording/replay is based on time rather than frames.<br>-Optimisation required.<br>-Adding image to simulation only shows the image shadow on canvas + image is stretched to fit canvas (should preserve size rather than fit to size) + only PNG|
|V0.15.5|17/11/24|3D Object Importation|Added 3D Object Importation with very limited functionality. Camera rotation around axes will be available soon!|-Not a bug related to the program, but camera or object might be unaligned with the chosen axis (could be an object only issue, as public 3D models were used for testing)|
|V0.15|14/11/24|Precision Simulation|Added iteration and resolution sliders that can help get more accurate simulations|-**Major:** running project on less cores or cores with lower clocks and toggling vectors drops fps from 60fps avg (monitor capped) to around 20-25fps<br> -Not really a bug, but could use optimisation|
|V0.1|11/11/24|Basic Simulation with Circle|Simulation with circle. Able to view: pressure, streamlines, smoke, fps and vectors.|- Simulation doesn't work properly outside or near the perimeter of canvas.<br>- Circle reinitialisation doesn't change fluid sim until dragged.|
