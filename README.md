# FDS-FX | JavaFX Fluid Dynamic Simulator
JavaFX Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulator is a simple 2D and 3D fluid dynamics simulator.

## Description
This project has been inspired by ***Ten Minute Physics*** and is a tweaked version of the fluidSim project with added features. FDS-FX is capable of importing 3D objects and looking at fluid behaviour in 2D and 3D.
